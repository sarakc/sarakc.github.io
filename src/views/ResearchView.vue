    <h1>Research</h1>
    My research interests lie at the intersection of computational modeling, theoretical morphology, typology, and psycholinguistics. I also maintain active interests in the documentation and description of endangered and low-resource languages, software development for field linguists, and community-based methods for the collection, annotation, and archival of multimedia linguistic data.
